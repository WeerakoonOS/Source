<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>I like music as most of do.I love to fresh gadgets like brandnew smartphones, smartwatches, Laptops, 
power banks like everything that is untouched.I enjoy volunteering
as part of my undergraduate life.It makes the anxiety vanish off.So its a good therapy to myself.On the other hand I like shoes, nail polish very much.
My whole day is a happy day when my hair supports it.I love to wear hair in different styles.Though
 it is natural and some finds it to be boring I find its just amazing and supportive.

 I think it's only natural that all of us have a hobby of some shape or form. Something that can keep boredom away, broaden our horizons, and inspire our creativity. For some of us one hobby might not even be enough, some of us have two, three, or many hobbies to fill our days and bring variety and fun into our lives. For some of us we love the solitary time that hobbies such as reading or swimming provide but for others one of the benefits to having a regular hobby is getting regular social time. In my opinions, hobbies are what keep us sane. I mean, how boring would life be if it was just work, eat, sleep, watch a little TV...

 You get the picture!

 So for those of you that haven't yet discovered your ideal hobby I've compiled this list of thirty-five of what I consider to be the best hobbies out there. Hopefully they'll inspire you, entertain you, and fill your days with a little excitement.</p>
